	~ NOT STARTED ~

- traveling to different areas (randomized with seventh sanctum names?)
- on page refresh, or on game start, first choose which kind of victory you want to achieve (certain number of nuts/peanuts? Defeat storyline? Get 'x' number of uniques?)



	~ IN PROGRESS ~

- Scratch ticket reward system (make more interesting)
- Uniques (Name of unique rewarded is randomized. ex: "Pistachio of Disbelief" or "Walnut from Heaven")



	~ COMPLETED ~
